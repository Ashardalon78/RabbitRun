Game Info
-------------------
The rabbits have been transformed into evil wolves by some unknown power. You are the only rabbit left and have to turn the wolves back into rabbits to ensure peace.
Avoid wolves at all costs, they do not remember their once peaceful rabbit nature and will attack you without reason on sight! Collect carrots,
as these will grant you the power to make wolves remember their peaceful origin and transform them back into rabbits. Stand together with other
rabbits against the power of the wolves!
 
 
Gameplay
-------------------
When having 5 or more carrots, you can turn a wolf back into a rabbit by pressing space (transforms closest wolf). Saved rabbits assist you for some time,
they will start blinking before they disappear. When teaming up with other rabbits (touching them), you can convince wolves of their rabbit-nature when they attack.
They will give you a carrot and disappear. You can see that you are teamed up when your rabbit turns green. You win a stage when you transform 5 wolves back into
rabbits. The game has 3 stages, wolves will be more dangerous and appear more frequently in later stages.
